Per usual, the amount of work that goes into a portfolio project isn't overwhelming so much as the amount of planning and testing that needs to go into it. I had a pretty solid idea and got through the majority of coding in two days (not including a restart at the behest of someone much wiser than me), but every hiccup I ran into afterwards took some though and the integration of previously acquired knowledge to solve. Reading back didn't always help, either.

Once I got past initial bug testing, I found it interesting to go through my app through a user's perspective, to make sure they were only seeing things I wanted them to see. I didn't spend too long on the HTML or CSS, I just wanted to make sure that the things I wanted them to see were there and nothing else.

I, of course, could go on nearly endlessly with this project to fully flesh it out and make it look as pretty as it is, but that is the nature of any project, right?
