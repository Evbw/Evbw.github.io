I just spent roughly a week away from my daily lessons and labs, and let me tell you that's a difficult thing to come back to after spending nearly every day of the past 3 months working on them.

However, there is an easy way to get back into the rhythm and that's to go back a few lessons and bring yourself back up to speed. How about we examine Box Styles?

Hmm, yes, very good. The box style is representative of life. It contains everything you want it to, and it can contain anything else. You can make the borders as thick as you like and even add a little padding if you need more space. With adequate knowledge and sufficient dedication you can make it look how you like as well.

How zen.
