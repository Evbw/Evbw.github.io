Sinatra has been causing me a lot of trouble. For various reasons I haven't been able to properly import a table , or a method wasn't calling the proper page, or any of a half-dozen other issues. However, each problem has been an opportunity to further refine my voice and understand what steps need to be taken to properly execute the code.

I learned the ins and outs of RESTful routing when trying to create a page that would allow a user to add recipes. It was an appropriate lab, as I also had to carefully list each step in order to make sure the final result was what I intended. Every typo required a closer inspection of the route and that helped me better understand.

How fitting!
