I had a wacky time trying to get this project started due to the fundamental shift from previous lessons. Once I got started though, I started making what I felt were tremendous strides and felt more confident in my actual coding skills. I rarely had to look up how to do something, so when I sought help it was easy for the Flatiron coaches to tighten up my code and make it more presentable.

However comma there were many elements I fell flat on. It's been so long since the initial Git lessons, and because I didn't re-read the instructions before getting started in earnest, I...Mishandled certain parts of my project. Once again the Flatiron coaches were able to shore up the gaps in my knowledge which also helped me identify weaknesses as far as coding goes.

I find I keep mentally pushing myself to go faster, but I worry that because of that desire I sometimes miss things. In college I developed an informal method of productively procrastinating, which involved setting up preparations so that when I did get to work everything would run much smoother. I contrast this with times I would unproductively procrastinate with an unrelated task, like washing the dishes (I know you may consider that productive, but it wasn't related to the task at hand). I think it would be wise to more carefully prepare for future projects and confirm I know what the hell I'm doing first.
